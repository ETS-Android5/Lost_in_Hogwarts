# Lost in Hogwarts - Adventure Game

Android text adventure game. The room/location information is stored in an XML file. This was one of the final assignments of the module COM502 - Internet and Mobile Application Development in Wrexham Glyndŵr University (United Kingdom).

### Difficulties and how I solved them

I think that the whole process of creating the game and structure was not difficult. However, it was a long process the fact of developing the whole diagram of rooms of the ‘castle’ and the connections between them. At first, I decided to do just a few floors but finally, I decided to do a bit of research and do the whole castle. It is just not very difficult to do because the code would work and do the same with fewer or more rooms.

For that, I strongly believe that coding the functions was more difficult than developing the castle locations. I had a bit of a problem when I was trying to save the game and store the information in an XML file. It took me time to make it work because the file was successfully exported but then it wasn’t readable. Finally, I could manage to do it.

Some actions of the castle, such as the random movement of the cat or the craft and use button took me time too because there were cases where these buttons failed or there were inconsistencies. However, everything worked in the end.

To sum up, I found this assignment a very interesting way of learning how to develop a text game. I learned a lot of new skills that I will use in the future. It was a good experience.
